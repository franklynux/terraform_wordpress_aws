## **1. Project Overview**

### **Introduction**

This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable, fault-tolerant WordPress application on AWS using Terraform. The deployment follows industry best practices, ensuring a secure, optimized, and highly available setup.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (EC2, RDS, ALB, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, EFS)
- **Application**: WordPress

### **Features**

- Highly available and scalable architecture.
- Secure setup with IAM roles and least privilege.
- Automated deployment and configuration.
- Health monitoring and logging.

## **2. Introduction to Terraform**

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It enables you to manage cloud resources efficiently and consistently, making it easier to automate infrastructure deployment and management.

### **Terraform Modules**

Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module can be thought of as a package of Terraform configurations that can be reused across different projects. By organizing your configurations into modules, you can promote code reuse and maintainability.

### **Variables and Outputs**

- **Variables**: Variables allow you to parameterize your Terraform configurations. They enable you to define values that can be reused throughout your configuration files, making it easier to manage and customize your infrastructure.
- **Outputs**: Outputs are used to extract information from your Terraform configurations. They allow you to display values after the infrastructure has been created, making it easier to reference important information such as resource IDs or endpoints.

### **Terraform `.tfvars` Files**

`.tfvars` files are used to define variable values in a separate file, allowing you to manage configurations more easily. By using `.tfvars` files, you can keep sensitive information and environment-specific settings out of your main configuration files.

## **3. Prerequisites**

### **Environment Setup**

- **Installed Tools**: Ensure the following tools are installed:
  - Terraform
  - AWS CLI
  - SSH client
- **AWS Account**: An AWS account with access keys configured.
- **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of Terraform and AWS services.

### **Resource Requirements**

- **Domain Name**: Required if using Route 53 for DNS.
- **SSL Certificate**: Optional, for HTTPS setup.
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure sufficient IAM permissions to create resources.

## **4. Infrastructure Architecture**

### **Diagram**

Provide a detailed architecture diagram here. Ensure the diagram includes key resources like ALB, RDS, EC2, VPC, and EFS.

---

## **5. Deployment Steps**

### **5.1 Setting Up Terraform**

1. **Install Terraform**:
   - Download Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   - Install the AWS CLI and configure it with your AWS credentials:

     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

   - Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format.

3. **Directory Structure**:

   ```plaintext
   ├── backend.tf
   ├── main.tf
   ├── outputs.tf
   ├── variables.tf
   ├── modules/
   │   ├── alb/
   │   ├── asg/
   │   ├── dynamodb/
   │   ├── efs/
   │   ├── networking/
   │   ├── rds/
   │   ├── s3/
   │   └── vpc/
   ```

4. **Backend Configuration**:
   - Use S3 and DynamoDB for Terraform state management.

5. **Variables and Outputs**:
   - Define reusable variables in `variables.tf`.
   - Provide meaningful outputs in `outputs.tf`.

### **5.2 Setting Up the Terraform Project Directory**

1. **Create the Main Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir terraform_wordpress_aws
   cd terraform_wordpress_aws
   ```

2. **Create Subdirectories for Modules**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p modules/alb modules/asg modules/dynamodb modules/efs modules/networking modules/rds modules/s3 modules/vpc modules/wp-server
   ```

3. **Create Required Terraform Files**:
   - Create the following files in the root directory:
     - `backend.tf`
     - `main.tf`
     - `outputs.tf`
     - `variables.tf`
     - `terraform.tfvars`

4. **Initialize Terraform**:
   - Run the following command to initialize the Terraform working directory:

     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```

### **5.3 Deployment Steps for Each Module**

- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**:
  1. Ensure the ALB module is configured in `main.tf`.
  2. Verify security group settings to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
  3. Check the health check path to ensure it matches your application.

- **ASG (Auto Scaling Group)**:
  1. Configure the ASG module in `main.tf` to define desired capacity and scaling policies.
  2. Ensure the launch template is set up correctly with the necessary AMI and instance type.

- **DynamoDB**:
  1. Define the DynamoDB table in the `dynamodb` module.
  2. Set up read/write capacity units based on your application needs.

- **EFS (Elastic File System)**:
  1. Configure the EFS module to create a file system.
  2. Ensure mount targets are set up in the appropriate subnets.

- **Networking**:
  1. Verify the VPC and subnet configurations in the networking module.
  2. Ensure route tables are correctly associated with the subnets.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
  1. Configure the RDS module with the desired database engine and instance type.
  2. Ensure security groups allow access from the application servers.

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:
  1. Define the S3 bucket in the S3 module.
  2. Set up bucket policies and versioning as needed.

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
  1. Ensure the VPC module is configured with the correct CIDR block.
  2. Verify that subnets are created in the appropriate availability zones.

- **WP Server (WordPress Server)**:
  1. Configure the WP server module to deploy the WordPress application.
  2. Ensure that the server has access to the RDS instance and EFS.

### **5.4 Documentation for Terraform Scripts**

Add detailed comments to the Terraform scripts to explain the purpose of each resource, module, and configuration.

### **5.5 Post Deployment Steps**

- **Access WordPress**: Use the ALB endpoint to access WordPress.
- **Complete Installation**: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the WordPress admin account.
- **Verify Database Connectivity**: Confirm that WordPress is connected to the RDS instance.

### **5.6 Terraform Commands for Setup and Deployment**

1. **`terraform init`**: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
2. **`terraform plan`**: Creates an execution plan for changes.
3. **`terraform apply`**: Applies changes to reach the desired state.
4. **`terraform validate`**: Validates the configuration syntax.
5. **`terraform destroy`**: Destroys all resources managed by Terraform.

## **6. Monitoring and Logging**

- Use CloudWatch for metrics and logs.
- Set up alarms for resource utilization.
- Enable access logs for ALB and S3.

---

## **7. Security Considerations**

- Use HTTPS with ACM for secure connections.
- Rotate IAM credentials regularly.
- Restrict SSH access to known IP addresses.

---

## **8. Troubleshooting**

- **Issue**: ALB health check failures.
  - **Solution**: Verify security group rules and health check path.
- **Issue**: Database connection errors.
  - **Solution**: Check RDS security groups and subnet configurations.

---

## **9. Additional Enhancements**

- Implement CI/CD pipelines.
- Configure multi-region disaster recovery.

---

## **10. Cleanup**

1. Run `terraform destroy` to remove all resources.
2. Empty S3 buckets before deletion if `force_destroy` is not enabled.

---

## **11. Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to deploying WordPress on AWS using Terraform. Continuous improvement and feedback are encouraged.
